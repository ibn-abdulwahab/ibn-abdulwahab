  <summary>More about me üèπ</summary>
  
### The beginning: First mobile app
During my early years at Nasarawa State University (2015), I realized that it's way too difficult for students to get exam-like formatted resources and prepare for examinations. Realizing also that my experience with Visual Basic from coursework wouldn't help, I used a month to learn Java and another to learn Android development (smiles! Android Studio first released), and in the period of 4 months I released my first mobile application (General Studies, GST) with 2000+ active users in and outside our university.

### Facing the reality: University examination system
Traveling to 2020, the university's board noticed the impact the mobile application was making. They then tasked me with the design and development of a computerized examination system for the whole university's campuses. We formed a team of four people, used Adobe XD to design the user interface (UI), then borrowed my Java skills and incorporated them with JavaFx. It was smooth leading the team and developing the solution until the examinations commenced, when we realized that the system could not handle the traffic. I can still feel the coldness of the server room we spent the night in, scaling, fixing the solution, backing up data, and configuring other servers as backups. At the end, we celebrated the adoption of the system by the university.

### Moving on: I exit from education only niche  
I completed my stay until 2021 at the university as a Technician with the department of Computer science, guiding students in translating the theoretical aspects of their studies into practical applications. and also contributed to writing the practical manuals for the department.

### And my flutter journey?
Well, I learned the fundamentals of Flutter 2019, but then it wasn't much richer, just stateful widgets ahead in state management with few database supports. Can I say just sharedpreference and .....? I don't know. Anyway, I started using Flutter actively from 2021, and since then, Flutter has become my life. My portfolio and online activities will speak more from .... Oops! I need to code.
